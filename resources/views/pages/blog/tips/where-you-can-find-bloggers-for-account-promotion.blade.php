                    <p>Often, when the promoting an Instagram page is underway, many problems are rising along the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>One of the pressing problems is finding bloggers to buy advertising. After all, many can't
                        afford
                        to
                        pay for advertising from millionaire bloggers. So, you have to look for other active blogs
                        with
                        real
                        subscribers.</p>

                    <h2>
                        Best ways to find bloggers for advertising
                    </h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/blog/blogger/ways-to-find-bloggers.jpg') }}"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>


                    <p>Use geolocation. Instagram have a search by geolocation, where you can find bloggers in
                        special
                        areas. Use the search box to enter the places closest to your target audience.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can also use the geolocation of a particular event, which is similar to the theme of the
                        promoted account. Go to the official page of the event itself, find the marked posts of the
                        blogger,
                        evaluate his account and order advertising.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But there is a downside to this method. Some users like to mark an implausible popular
                        location
                        to
                        attract the attention of subscribers. Therefore, you need to carefully assess the accounts
                        of
                        such
                        bloggers, and pay attention to the overall theme and location of their profiles.
                    </p>

                    <p>Hashtags. In this case, the search function of Instagram comes in handy again. Use search box
                        to
                        enter a certain hashtag associated with your target audience or with the theme of your
                        account.
                        And
                        the social network will automatically give out popular pages that have something to do with
                        the
                        request.</p>
                    <p>There is a small nuance: it is better to enter what may be written in the header of the
                        profile
                        of a
                        person. For example, you need the theme of cooking, and you should enter the following
                        words:
                        cook,
                        chef, and so on. That is, the key query must match the header of the blogger's profile.</p>
                    <p>The method is often suitable for those who are looking for people of a certain profession.
                        Unfortunately, it will be difficult to find a blogger of related interests in this case.</p>


                    <p>Subscriptions to bloggers with same subjects. This method is usually suitable for those who
                        specialize in blogging on narrow subjects. As a rule, people subscribe to their colleagues,
                        or
                        bloggers of interest.</p>
                    <p>Of course, as in any way, there are disadvantages. It is necessary to select bloggers for
                        advertising manually. Also, blogs in which were used services of the pimping and mass
                        following
                        are
                        not suitable. The subscriptions of popular bloggers show not only fellow bloggers, but also
                        relatives and friends, who have to be selected and scrolled through. All this takes time and
                        patience.</p>
                    <p>"Interesting" in the feed. Instagram has such a good feature as a search for publications by
                        account
                        interest. That is, the social network automatically calculates what the owner of the profile
                        is
                        interested in and automatically gives out posts with similar content in the feed. It's a
                        great
                        way
                        to find a blogger to advertise with such publications. All you have to do is to monitor the
                        posts,
                        sift out unnecessary bloggers and select suitable accounts.</p>

                    <p>Disadvantages of this method:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The "Interesting" rubric often contains publications by bloggers of millionaires;</li>
                        <li>Publications are not sorted by geographic data;</li>
                        <li>It is difficult to find "average" bloggers, as the feed often contains either large
                            blogs or
                            very insignificant ones.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Competitors and their advertising. You can find your own competitors, and follow their ways
                        of
                        promotion. Their subscriptions often include bloggers with whom you collaborate. Or they tag
                        them in their posts.

                    </div>

                    <p>Blogger Database. You can find several databases on the Internet that feature both large and
                        medium-sized bloggers. They based on potential advertisers.</p>
                    <p>The pros of such databases: you do not need to analyze the accounts yourself; built-in
                        filters to
                        find the necessary blogs; getting statistics on coverage and target audience.</p>
                    <p>Databases offer not only a list of suitable bloggers for advertising, but also to come up
                        with
                        the
                        ad itself, as well as to agree on its publication. Some of the most popular services
                        include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GetBlogger. They have the widest base with more than 40,000 different bloggers. In
                            general,
                            the service does everything independently, users only need to find the right account to
                            place
                            ads.
                        </li>
                        <li>Yoloco. Database is slightly less than the previous one. This base includes search on
                            certain
                            parameters, coverage and target audience statistics.
                        </li>
                        <li>InBlogs. The main advantage of the service – you can check any account for the
                            effectiveness
                            of advertising in it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>Not everyone likes such a search. Many note that through the base with the blogger is
                        difficult
                        to
                        negotiate a barter deal, or send goods to check the quality. In addition, advertising prices
                        are
                        often inflated by commissions. And there are no guarantees that the accounts do not have
                        cheated
                        subscribers.</p>
                    <p>Telegram chats. At the moment, it is not difficult to find such chats. Some of them recommend
                        certain accounts for advertising, while others are based on bots activity.</p>
                    <p>One nuance of this method: the bloggers who are recommended by Telegram Channels are often
                        loaded
                        with advertisements, you have to wait for a certain free date. It also indicates that the
                        price
                        will
                        be too high, the audience is tired of advertising. Thus, the effectiveness of promotion will
                        be
                        low.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cons: reviews in such chat rooms are not always believable. Sometimes unscrupulous bloggers
                        for
                        their own promotion add fake positive feedback to the chats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is desirable to use more than one method of search at a time. If you take only 1 or 2
                        methods
                        as
                        a basis, then the range of accounts is narrowed and the search can take a long time. You can
                        create
                        your own hypotheses. For example, think about where the bloggers you need for advertising
                        can
                        appear, whom they subscribe to, and where they are active.
