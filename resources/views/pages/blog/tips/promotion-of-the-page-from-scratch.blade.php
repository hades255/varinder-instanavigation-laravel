                    <p>With the idea of starting a blog appear different fears. One creates an account, arranges
                        everything
                        beautifully, and the user starts waiting anxiously for the followers to appear, but they are
                        not
                        coming. And, of course, one starts thinking that it is impossible to be a successful
                        blogger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, everyone has been down this road. Promoting an account will be difficult until it
                        has
                        at
                        least 3,000 of the first followers.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Conditions before promotion</h2>

                    <p> Before starting to promote an Instagram account, it is important to examine whether it could
                        be
                        potentially interesting for future followers.
                    </p>
                    <p> The conditions for testing are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A filled-out bio. It should be as clear to people as possible what the blog is about.
                        </li>
                        <li>Set up a business account. It is crucial for bloggers. One can only monitor the
                            statistics
                            and
                            the arrival of followers after advertising.
                        </li>
                        <li>Instagram profile filled with at least 12 posts. New followers are unlikely to be
                            interested
                            in
                            an empty page. They need to see activity, useful information in the profile.
                        </li>
                        <li>No sales content. Until a profile reaches 1000 followers, it is not recommended to sell
                            anything if the account is not a shop.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Free promotion techniques</h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/blog/page-promotion/free-ways.jpg') }}"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Tell your acquaintances, friends, and relatives about the blog. They will become the
                            first
                            active subscribers, will support the novice blogger. If you have a page on other social
                            networks, you can place an announcement there about the presence of the blog on
                            Instagram.
                            You
                            can also take advantage of the client base (if you already have one) and send out a
                            newsletter.
                        </li>
                        <li>Follow the accounts with a target audience, like their posts, and comment on them. Thus,
                            there
                            is a chance for the promoted account to be noticed, people may visit it and subscribe.
                            The
                            main
                            point is to be active, to remind people of the blog's existence wherever possible. If
                            you
                            know
                            your target audience, you can get to know them, communicate with them, subscribe to each
                            other,
                            and like each other.
                        </li>
                        <li>One can hold a contest if the account already has a certain number of followers. For
                            example,
                            ask them to share a post or story on their pages; in return, the blogger chooses one
                            winner
                            randomly.
                        </li>
                        <li>Test little-known ways of promotion. Firstly, there are plenty of such methods, you can
                            find
                            them on the Internet. Secondly, major bloggers do not use such methods, which means that
                            most
                            Instagram users do not know them. This will attract a more loyal audience to the
                            account.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Challenge is a great modern method of Instagram account promotion. The idea is that
                            subscribers fulfill certain conditions (dance, sing, cook a dish, and so on), make a
                            post or
                            story mentioning the promoted account. That is how a lot of people will find out about
                            the
                            page.
                            Write comments under popular posts on the subject of the account. For example, if the
                            theme
                            of the profile is recipes, you can search for publications of recipes and comment on
                            them.
                            The comment must be interesting and engaging so that users can notice it, go to the
                            account,
                            evaluate it, and possibly follow it.
                            According to this method it is recommended to proceed as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>choose 10 popular hashtags on the subject of the account;</li>
                                <li> write comments under 9 posts on a daily basis;</li>
                                <li>comments are to be exciting and detailed;</li>
                                <li>posts should have more than 5% of likes from the total amount of page followers.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Why the techniques may not work</h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/blog/page-promotion/not-useful-ways.jpg') }}"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>If there are still no or few followers after a certain period of time, many people give up.
                        There
                        may be many reasons for that.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The profile is not suitable for blogging. And this is easy to check, just answer a
                            number of
                            questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Does the profile topic make sense to most people?</li>
                                <li>Why does one need to subscribe to this page? How can it be useful?</li>
                                <li>Are there attractive photos? Do the posts match the theme of the blog?</li>
                                <li>Are the texts of the posts easy to read? Can they be understood on a cursory
                                    reading?
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>The content of the account is not suitable for the target audience, which is attracted
                            by
                            promotional means. If you leave comments under posts about fitness and invite people to
                            watch
                            videos of kitties, it is unlikely that followers will pay attention to the account.
                        </li>
                        <li>The account isn’t active. One should make posts regularly, preferably 1-2 posts a day.
                            That’s
                            how the users of the social network will understand that the account is active, where
                            plenty
                            of
                            useful information is posted, one can go through it every day.
                        </li>

                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">The main points of promotion</h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/blog/page-promotion/common-promotion-ways.jpg') }}"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>It is important to use all the free promotion methods daily. If you spend only one hour
                            a
                            day
                            on promotion, you're unlikely to get results quickly. It is necessary to try new ways,
                            to
                            test,
                            to experiment.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is important to keep statistics of the promotion in order to assess which methods
                            work
                            better and which do not do any good. You can also change the tactics of how to use them.
                            Perhaps, some mistakes have been made.
                        </li>
                        <li>One can create a tracker of regular activities to get used to the obligations of
                            promoting
                            an
                            account. If one remains idle, the account won’t promote itself, and Instagram users will
                            not
                            know about the page.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>So, to get more than 3000 followers in your account on short notice, you should work on the
                        promotion regularly. This applies not only to the actions of the profile owner but also to
                        the
                        content itself.</p>
                    <p>You can facilitate the task with such a simple action as planning. Create a precise plan for
                        promotion and stick to it until the goal is achieved. Another very good recommendation from
                        the
                        experts is to treat the promotion of the account like a game. In this case, the excitement
                        will
                        take over and it will go faster.</p>
