                    <p>Professional photographers and bloggers provide many guidelines for photo processing. Here
                        are
                        some of them:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Always be inspired by examples so that you have new ideas. For example, you can
                                    use
                                    Pinterest for this purpose;
                                </li>
                                <li>Don't spend a lot of time processing one photo. Otherwise, any result will seem
                                    boring
                                    and ugly to you;
                                </li>
                                <li>Save the processed material in the highest resolution, otherwise the picture
                                    will
                                    lose
                                    quality.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 text-center">
