                    <p>In social networks, there is always a section that describes the rules of conduct on the
                        platform. On Instagram, the developers also made requirements for users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often users do not even open this section, and then they break the rules and wonder why they
                        got
                        blocked. If you don't want to face this situation, you can check out the list of basic
                        Instagram
                        requirements here.

                    <p>In 2018-2019, a few more rules appeared that should also be taken into account this year.</p>
                    <p>If you are planning to release your guide or relationship post, don't rush it. The content
                        will
                        have
                        to be processed so that both children and adults can read it.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise, the authors of articles about relationships from the point of view of psychology
                        will
                        be
                        banned. This also applies to those people who publish candid photos and blog about intimate
                        relationships.</p>
                    <p>In 2019, it was popular among bloggers to talk about ways to make quick money on Instagram.
                        Many
                        posted links to the Telegram channels of scammers, "privateers" who promised mountains of
                        money
                        for
                        a minimal investment. Now any kind of content that mentions big earnings is blocked in a
                        matter
                        of
                        days for violation.</p>
                    <p>Even on the platform, it was forbidden to beg for likes and comments. Users often ask to rate
                        their
                        photos in exchange for the same action, but they do not fulfill their duty.
                        Mass complaints about such people led to the emergence of a rule on Instagram about likes
                        and
                        comments. Also, do not forget Instagram limits, they have also been updated for new and old
                        accounts.</p>
                    <p>
                        Copyright protection has become even tougher. Now you can not publish other people's
                        drawings,
                        photos, videos, trademarks, and logos. This is the intellectual property of others.
                        If you post something like this, you are violating copyright laws. Content may not be
                        deleted,
                        but
                        if other users send complaints to it, it will be blocked literally immediately.

                    <p>In December 2020, many Instagrammers received a notification that some features of the app
                        were
                        now
                        disabled. Many remained at a loss, because. The Instagram administration did not explain
                        anything.
                        What was it?</p>
                    <p>
                        Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union “on
                        privacy
                        and electronic communications” sets new requirements for the use and collection of data on
                        social
                        networks. Therefore, Facebook was forced to territorially disable some functions for users.
