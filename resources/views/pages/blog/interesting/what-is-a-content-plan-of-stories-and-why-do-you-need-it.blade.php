                    <p>Account promotion on Instagram without a content plan is almost impossible. A blog might be
                        regularly filled with posts, it might be arranged prettily, yet the statistics of its
                        development
                        will constantly be fluctuating. It's the same as if a person doesn't know the road, driving
                        without
                        a navigator or map. He seems to be moving forward, but he doesn't know where he's going.</p>
                    <p>
                        A content plan is, first of all, a helper for a blogger, which provides structured
                        information
                        about
                        further publications in the profile/stories.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">The benefit of forming a content plan</h2>

                    <p> Before you start writing this plan, you need to identify the main goal of blog development
                        in
                        social media. They can be different:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sale of goods or services. Typically, stores and other commercial accounts have this
                            goal.
                            Such
                            a blog does not hide that it sells something, and at what cost.
                        </li>
                        <li>The attraction of potential customers. A blog is created for the attraction of the
                            specific
                            target audience so that in the future some followers become clients. That is, the main
                            task
                            is
                            not to sell, but to attract.
                        </li>
                        <li>To gain popularity. The main purpose of the account is to make the brand or personality
                            recognizable, popular. And the content plan will be created to promote the personal
                            brand.
                        </li>
                        <li>Interaction with clients. There are no sales in this case. It is just communication with
                            followers, who can become clients of the company in the future.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        A content plan itself will not bring you any followers and will not make an account more
                        popular. Its main purpose is to facilitate the working process in the account.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">The first steps of creating a plan</h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/blog/content-plan/first-step-to-create-content-plan.jpg') }}"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The first thing to do is to choose the program and device to use the content plan
                        conveniently.
                        Many people like to make a plan in the form of a table.</p>
                    <p>What should necessarily be in the table:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Date (day.month.year);</li>
                        <li>Time of stories publication (sometimes you can just specify morning, noon, evening);
                        </li>
                        <li>Type of content (entertaining, informative, pre-sale, sale).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>With these principles in place, you begin to write the content plan. If you already have
                        stories
                        ready for publication, you can save them to cloud storage in separate folders or save them
                        in
                        draft stories on Instagram.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">The second step is metric</h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/blog/content-plan/metrica.jpg') }}" class="post-image-on-full-width">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The content plan should effectively influence the engagement of followers. That’s why it is
                        crucial
                        to analyze every story to fix your mistakes in the future. Special metrics exist for these
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>Metric is a tool in the form of an app, which allows evaluating the published stories
                        according
                        to
                        content plan, to carry out comparisons of the set tasks with the fulfillment of them.</p>
                    <p>What metric does:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It shows what reach and how many views did a story have. Namely, it is important to
                            monitor
                            how
                            many people watched a story in general. These metrics influence the cost of an ad. The
                            more
                            accounts are reached, the higher cost can be set for the ad mockups placement in
                            stories. In
                            addition, it has now become popular to organize marathons. Bloggers participate in them
                            as
                            speakers and pay for the participation. And the cost of participation directly depends
                            on
                            the
                            amount of reach.
                        </li>
                        <li>Tracking "forward" or "backward" actions. In this case, you can understand which stories
                            the
                            followers were most interested in. If there was a game, you can easily see which
                            questions/tasks
                            were difficult for people.
                        </li>
                        <li>Exit from the stories. This metric is quite unpleasant for bloggers. One should monitor
                            it
                            during ad placement. This is how it can be identified whether the ad was useful and
                            whether
                            it
                            is appropriate for the target audience.
                        </li>
                        <li>Subscribers' reactions to stories. It's important to monitor followers' interactions
                            with
                            the
                            blogger and their stories. These metrics will increase with the emergence of response
                            stickers
                            or surveys.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        It is convenient to place metrics in the content plan. This allows to visually assess which
                        stories are of interest, where it is best to add stickers, which ads should not be placed in
                        the
                        future, and so on.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">The third step is filling a content plan</h2>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/blog/content-plan/content-image.jpg') }}"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>What should be placed in the columns of the content plan? It is best to describe each story
                        and
                        each
                        action in detail. Here is an example:</p>
                    <p>Monday - show the product on sale, tell what's available and what's on order;</p>
                    <p>Tuesday - explain what to look for when choosing a product in this store;</p>
                    <p>Wednesday – tell about current special offers;</p>
                    <p>Thursday – tell the story of product appearance.</p>

                    <p>This content plan is too simple. You can write out one story each day. For example, in the
                        morning
                        you can wish your followers a good start to the day; an hour later you can tell them how
                        you're
                        doing and what the blogger had for breakfast; in the afternoon you can post a commercial,
                        and in
                        the
                        evening you can make a quiz.</p>
                    <p>
                        The more detailed is your plan, the easier it would be to be on Instagram. Also, it will
                        make
                        the
                        analysis process easier.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's important to understand that no matter how good the stories are, there's no point in
                        just
                        being happy that they generally exist. It is necessary to regularly monitor how subscribers
                        react to the content, what interests they have. In general, the effectiveness of any
                        business,
                        including the development of an Instagram profile depends on proper planning.
