                    <p>Analyzing your competitors' pages is an essential part of promoting your account. It is the
                        analysis
                        that will allow you to learn what subscribers are interested in, what new trends exist in
                        the
                        field,
                        and how to do better than your competitors.</p>
                    <p>
                        How to analyze of competitors correctly will be described in detail below.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        How to find your competitors on Instagram
                    </h2>

                    <p>The most up-to-date and effective search on Instagram is on the app itself. Just enter a
                        keyword
                        in
                        the search box on the subject area of the account, and the social network will automatically
                        display
                        a list of the most popular accounts.</p>
                    <p>
                        For the first analysis, such a list of competitors will be enough. The more popular the
                        account
                        is,
                        the more complicated it is to analyze and search for competitors.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Content analysis</h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">

                    </div>

                    <p>After the performance of the first stage (search and selection of necessary competitor pages
                        for
                        analysis), you can proceed to the second one. The second step, in general, contains the
                        process
                        of
                        analysis. And it is divided into several directions, each requiring thorough work.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is advised to start the analysis with the content. It's easier to make a conscious
                        decision
                        about
                        the visual component of your account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What to pay attention to when analyzing content:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>General visual data of the profile page. In this case, it is necessary to pay attention
                            to
                            the
                            bio of the profile and its design to obtain the interesting "features". More than 40
                            percent
                            of
                            potential clients pay attention to the profile bio. Evaluate the visual content in
                            general.
                            Whether there is a certain color scheme, whether the main colors in stories, posts,
                            highlights,
                            avatars match.
                        </li>
                        <li>Content of posts in the profile. Read several posts attentively, looking at the subject
                            matter.
                            You can also take some ideas for your content. For example, look at what your
                            competitors
                            have
                            been up to in the last two or three months. And take some ideas from these posts.
                        </li>
                        <li>How the interaction with followers is performed. You can easily check how quickly and
                            efficiently your competitors communicate with their clients. It is enough to write to
                            their
                            profile from a fake account and assess the level of their service. Customers appreciate
                            it
                            when
                            their problems and questions are solved quickly.
                        </li>
                        <li>Engagement of target audience. Analyze to what extent competitors are trying to draw
                            their
                            subscribers' attention to their accounts. How to do this? Monitor all content and find
                            out
                            whether polls, quizzes, and games are being used, and whether there are activities in
                            posts
                            and
                            stories.
                            You can borrow some ideas for activities, but not all of them may be suitable, you need
                            to
                            be
                            careful here. You can also borrow ideas about contests and giveaways from competitors.
                            The
                            most
                            effective ways to attract subscribers: people make a repost of the post/story of the
                            account
                            on
                            their page, tag their friends in the comments under the posts, the next day the contest
                            profile
                            chooses a winner using a randomizer. What do subscribers want? Prizes, of course. So,
                            they
                            need
                            to be relevant, popular, and valuable to the target audience. It is worth learning from
                            competitors: what conditions in contests to specify, how to conduct them, what to give
                            away.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sales content. It is important to find out how competitors sell, what key techniques
                            they
                            have
                            to persuade the customer to make a purchase.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    </div>

                    <p>As soon as you find the competitors, analyze their content, borrow valuable ideas, it is
                        necessary
                        to perform one more important step: analysis of account promotion.</p>
                    <p>All accounts on Instagram mostly use different ads. You need to find out your competitors'
                        strategy,
                        which determines the effectiveness of their advertising. For example, find out what leads
                        are
                        applied by competitors, what key requests are used, and so on. All this can be examined on
                        various
                        services.</p>
                    <p>
                        Targeted advertising is also a fairly good way to promote your Instagram page. It is
                        necessary
                        to
                        observe and identify whether competitors use target. It should be noted: what "tricks" are
                        used,
                        in
                        what format the ads are displayed. And you can find all targeting ads on Facebook. It is
                        enough
                        to
                        enter the name of the company in the search box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to what principles should you analyze the promotional offers of competitors?
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The visual part of the ad and text. One should several competitors for the analysis (for
                            example, two). Both of them use modern strategies, graphics, but still, have a different
                            style
                            of advertising. But there is one simple difference in their offers. The first one offers
                            clients
                            to buy a manual, learn new skills, and apply them, earning money. The second offers to
                            employ
                            trainees after training, and also promises to make the course the next day. In this
                            case,
                            the
                            conclusion is the following: when formulating the text, you should not promise customers
                            more
                            than you actually have.
                        </li>
                        <li>The goal of targeted advertising. Some accounts need many followers, others need
                            engagement,
                            others want to boost sales.
                            It's also worth noting how many ad layouts are displayed in the targeting. If the same
                            company
                            has several of the same ads, it means they are experimenting by targeting different
                            audiences.
                        </li>
                        <li>Authorities for followers. Most shops and brands have several bloggers, with who they
                            collaborate by buying the advertising regularly. The opinion of these bloggers is
                            exactly
                            what
                            followers respect. Therefore, their advertising will be more effective for the company.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
