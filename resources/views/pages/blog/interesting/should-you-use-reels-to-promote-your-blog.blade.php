                    <p>
                        Reels is a relatively recent feature of Instagram, which allows people to post short videos
                        to
                        the network to be seen not only by subscribers of the account, but also by other network
                        users.
                    </p>


                    <p>This function appeared in Instagram itself a year ago, but in Russia it only began to operate
                        in
                        June 2021. The fact is that many updates to the application reach each user gradually.</p>
                    <p>
                        Most bloggers began to understand Reels. Now it is important to understand whether this
                        feature
                        is
                        worth applying in the field of profile promotion?
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Key points of Reels
                    </h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="../../images/blog/instagram-reels/reels.jpg" class="post-image-on-full-width"
                                alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>


                    <p>
                        It's no secret that Reels came about because of the highly competitive Tick-Tock. In
                        essence,
                        the feature is completely similar to the aforementioned, new social network. What is
                        included in
                        Reels?
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Addition of musical accompaniment, which can easily be selected from a ready-made base;
                        </li>
                        <li>Application of various effects;</li>
                        <li>Shooting and mini-editing videos in Reels itself;</li>
                        <li>Filming in the form of a remix with other users.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>Stories have been functioning in Instagram for a long time. You can post short videos of 15
                        seconds
                        each, as well as overlay music from a common base. And many people have a question: what is
                        the
                        difference between Reels and Stories? Why was it invented?
                    </p>

                    <h2>The main advantages of using Reels are</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The length of the video is adjustable from 1 second to 60 seconds. There is no such
                            thing in
                            stories. The maximum recording of stories is 15 seconds.
                        </li>
                        <li>The new feature gives you the ability to post videos to your feed. When subscribers open
                            a
                            given video, the app automatically moves them to Reels. Among all posts, videos in this
                            format
                            are marked with a special sign.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reels can be viewed not only by the subscribers of the account, as it is provided for
                            ordinary
                            publications, but also by all other users of the social network. That is, the videos are
                            shown
                            to those people who are interested in the subject of the video.
                        </li>
                        <li>Increased base of tracks that can be superimposed on the videos. In addition, Instagram
                            allows
                            you to use your own music. It is possible to cut the audio track and insert the piece
                            you
                            need.
                            Some music users can simply save in a draft of their own Reels to use it in the future.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the video has the original sound, which you don't want to remove, but need to overlay
                            other
                            music, the new feature allows you to turn down the background sound to overlay other
                            audio.
                            It
                            is also possible to record a video without sound, and then use the voiceover.
                        </li>
                        <li>Creating duets (remixes). This is a video that is shot with another Instagram user.</li>
                        <li>You can change the speed of the video itself directly in the application. The social
                            network
                            offers a quadruple speed-up and a quintuple slow-down. But there is one nuance, it is
                            only
                            allowed to use such a function directly when shooting a video recording in Reels.
                        </li>
                        <li>Users have access to absolutely the entire base of different overlays and special
                            effects,
                            which are generally used in stories.
                        </li>
                        <li>Change the background of the video. The function is called Green Screen.</li>
                        <li>The timer allows start recording video for a certain amount of time after the REC button
                            is
                            pressed. The minimum start delay is 3 seconds and the maximum are 10 seconds.
                        </li>
                        <li>Dividing the video recording process into several "clips". That is, you can shoot
                            excerpts,
                            and
                            the whole video at once. The main thing is that the total time should not exceed 60
                            seconds.
                            For
                            example, you can shoot a single video in the application itself, then add a clip from
                            the
                            phone
                            archive, and continue shooting on Instagram. Reels will automatically edit and the total
                            clip
                            will appear in the feed.
                        </li>
                        <li>When a video is recorded in parts, the "alignment" feature will automatically appear.
                            That
                            is,
                            as the video is recorded, the position of the other parts will be displayed concerning
                            the
                            first
                            clip. Before the recording begins the phone, screen becomes transparent. Users like this
                            idea -
                            it's convenient for them to work with Reels in this way.
                        </li>
                        <li>Each piece of video that was shot individually can be edited and trimmed. But you can't
                            swap
                            pieces of a clip. If a video does not fit within 60 seconds, it will automatically be
                            trimmed by
                            the app.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">How Reels can affect account promotion</h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="../../images/blog/instagram-reels/account-promotion.jpg"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>


                    <p>In fact, the creative new feature of Instagram does not limit users to anything. The most
                        important
                        thing is to include imagination, possess skilled hands. And you can use Reels with all its
                        features.</p>
                    <p>What can be useful for the promotion of blogger accounts and commercial profiles?</p>
                    <p>First, the competition is a little less if you consider the promotion through Reels. While
                        this
                        is a
                        novelty, not everyone can use it properly in terms of promotion. Anything new to Instagram
                        has
                        several promotional advantages. It is necessary to start mastering the skills at once, in
                        order
                        to
                        have time to take your place in the aftermath.</p>


                    <p>Secondly, a new opportunity to use an unusual style of advertising in Reels. Facebook and
                        Instagram
                        have already started talking about how soon there will be a feature like tagging other
                        accounts
                        in
                        similar videos. This is a great opportunity to take it to the next level and start making
                        money
                        from
                        commercials.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, Reels is designed not only for the subscribers of the account, but for all Instagram
                        users
                        who are interested in the subject of the video. That is, people have displayed all the
                        videos
                        that
                        affect their interests. Thus, you can easily attract a new audience to the page.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, creating remixes with other bloggers also allows you to attract the attention of new
                        people.
                        This is a great way to promote at this point in the social network.</p>

                    <p>
                        Any new feature in Instagram is new opportunities and new ways in the promotion of the
                        profile.
                        It is necessary to quickly navigate and understand these functions to make the promotion
                        effective. And while Reels is not a popular way of promotion, it is necessary to use it.
