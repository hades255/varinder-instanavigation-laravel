                    <p>
                        Why Instagram can ban you? There are many reasons for this. The algorithm by which the
                        administration of the social network makes decisions on blocking is unknown to anyone except
                        the
                        administration itself. Nevertheless, the experience of many bloggers says that there is a
                        reliable
                        list of reasons why an account could be at risk of deletion.

                    <p>
                        In fact, there are many reasons why your Instagram page can be blocked. First of all, any
                        account must be developed exclusively according to the rules of the social network. Don't
                        forget
                        about website restrictions. We recommend that you know a few gross mistakes, for which more
                        than
                        one blog has been irretrievably deleted.
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Rapid account development. Some users don't want to wait for subscribers and work on
                            developing their page, and they start using third-party services for cheating. This
                            leads to
                            rapid growth in subscribers. The Instagram administration quickly suppresses such
                            actions
                            and blocks the profile.
                            At the same time, such actions are not useful. Bots can't bring engagement to your
                            target
                            audience, so there is no point in developing your page in this way. In addition,
                            Instagram
                            always compares post statistics with the number of subscribers. If a blogger has a large
                            audience, but gets a small number of likes in posts, then Instagram will hide this
                            profile
                            from other users.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Change of IP-address. If the profile was used under different IPs at different times,
                            then
                            you can't get banned for this. You need to confirm by email to which the profile is
                            linked
                            that the real owner has visited the page.
                            And if you go to your profile from different IP addresses several times in one day,
                            Instagram will consider these actions suspicious and may permanently delete the page
                            from
                            the social network.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Purchased account. There are services that sell profitable blogs. Yes, they have already
                            been promoted, you can just buy them and continue to develop them further. But the
                            Instagram
                            administration keeps track of IP addresses through which a large number of profiles are
                            created. And such accounts are blocked over time.
                            We recommend not buying pages, but creating and developing them yourself. Also, don't
                            register more than ten pages from one device. Otherwise, Instagram may take such actions
                            suspicious.
                        </li>

                        <li>Using someone else's photos or videos. According to the rules of the website, users are
                            prohibited from using photos of other people and photos taken from the Internet in their
                            accounts. Such profiles are blocked in 99% of cases.
                        </li>
                        <li>Photos of any documentation. The website doesn't allow the posting of various documents
                            on
                            the
                            web. These include: driver's license, website or email addresses, passport, insurance or
                            certificates, account or card numbers. You are prohibited from posting such information
                            in
                            the
                            form of photos and text.
                        </li>
                        <li>Creation of profiles not via a mobile device. At the moment there are many programs that
                            can
                            automatically register a large number of pages on a website. Instagram monitors and
                            prohibits
                            the use of such third-party apps. All accounts that were not created via a mobile device
                            are
                            permanently blocked.
                        </li>
                        <li>Publishing many posts with a break of a few seconds/minutes. Sometimes users create
                            pages
                            and
                            immediately start uploading a large number of photos, videos and posts there. Instagram
                            perceives such actions as spam and can permanently delete the profile.
                            We recommend that you publish posts no more than once an hour. The best tactic is one
                            day,
                            one
                            post.
                        </li>
                        <li> The same hashtags. The use of the same set of hashtags in each post leads to the fact
                            that
                            the social network stops showing these posts in the recommended ones.
                        </li>
                        <li>Brand creation. You need to be careful here. Instagram requires confirmation that the
                            account
                            is in fact a brand profile. And documentary confirmation is required. Therefore, if you
                            don't
                            have legal confirmation, then do not risk and not call the store a brand.
                        </li>
                        <li>Repetitive audience reactions. When a large number of identical comments are present
                            under
                            posts, Instagram takes these actions for spam. First, the administration will
                            temporarily
                            block
                            the ability for subscribers to leave comments under the posts of this profile. If the
                            situation
                            repeats, the page will be permanently deleted.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="../../images/blog/account-was-compromised/suspicion.jpg"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Any suspicious activity on Instagram entails the risk of account deletion. If you violated
                        one
                        rule,
                        and the profile was not deleted, then this doesn't mean that you can continue to do so
                        further.
                        A
                        cumulative effect is triggered. When your page has been found to be suspicious several
                        times,
                        Instagram will permanently delete it.</p>
                    <p>Pure and legal social media profiles are rarely blocked. But if this happened, then such an
                        action
                        can be easily challenged by communicating with technical support.</p>
                    <p>There is another interesting Instagram feature. If some violations were already in the
                        account,
                        but
                        after the expiration of time they stopped and didn't appear again, then the blocking risks
                        are
                        reduced. Therefore, when many bloggers feel the danger for their own page, they sometimes
                        give a
                        «break» to the profile.</p>
