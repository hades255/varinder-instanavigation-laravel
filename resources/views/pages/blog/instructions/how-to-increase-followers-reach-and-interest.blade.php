                    <p>Since Instagram introduced new features and rules, promoting profiles has become a difficult
                        action. Coverage has become much lower, and followers have little engagement with content.
                        Almost every blogger has lost some audience because of such changes. Going back to previous
                        stats is now considered impossible.
                    </p>

                    <p>If in 2014-2015 you could easily get 1000-2000 likes from subscribers under your posts, now
                        the
                        same
                        post will get a maximum of 200. And this undoubtedly saddens most beginning bloggers.</p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore it is time when it is necessary to think up new ways to increase the coverage, and
                        roll
                        out new cards on the table.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Feed content
                    </h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="../../images/blog/increase-subscribers/content.jpg" class="post-image-on-full-width"

                    </div>


                    <p>The Instagram audience has long been used to seeing beautiful posts. You have to match this
                        kind
                        of
                        content to increase the number of subscribers. After all, every like affects the reach
                        statistics.</p>
                    <p>If you look through the feeds of some bloggers, you can understand, there are more likes on
                        good,
                        high-quality photos than on home selfies. First and foremost, you shouldn't post:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>fuzzy photos;</li>
                        <li>blurry, poor quality, dark photos;</li>
                        <li>photos with smiley faces, placeholders, etc.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        It's best for each user to have their own style of photo design to stand out among the rest.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Don’t use any kind of spoofing</h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="../../images/blog/increase-subscribers/stop-using.jpg"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>When a profile has a large number of bots, subscribers who are not active in any way and do
                        not
                        view
                        the page, then they hang dead weight. Be sure to do a cleanup of the account. Such followers
                        will
                        never bring anything useful for promotion.</p>
                    <p>Instagram has this way: if the interaction of subscribers from Moscow (or other cities) with
                        the
                        content is not monitored, then other people from the city will not be interested in this
                        page.
                        Thus
                        Instagram simply will not show people the account.</p>
                    <p>It is important to clean the page every six months from bots, people who came from
                        mass-following,
                        untargeted audiences. From this account will not lose anything, but rather free itself from
                        unnecessary "cargo". It is not difficult to do. You can clean manually if there are not many
                        subscribers, or you can use special services.</p>


                    <h2 class="mt-4">Using hashtags</h2>

                    <p>Back in 2015, hashtags used to be very good at boosting a page's reach. At the moment, their
                        value
                        is a bit overstated. It's safe to say that hashtags are of no use and generally don't work
                        to
                        attract subscribers. But it is worth carefully studying your own page, perhaps users do find
                        useful
                        information for themselves on certain hashtags.</p>
                    <p>It is also not recommended to constantly use the same hashtags in every publication. And
                        sometimes
                        it is necessary to check them. Many hashtags in Instagram have become "trash" or just end up
                        being
                        blocked. It is better to choose a category with more than 100,000 posts.</p>
                    <p>To get to the top of a particular hashtag, you need to gather the largest number of likes
                        than
                        other
                        posts with the same hashtag in one minute after the publication of the post.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can use this method to raise the coverage as follows: agree with your friends (if there
                        are
                        a
                        large number of them) on a mutual placement of likes. This way you have a better chance of
                        getting
                        to the Top.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">
                        Finding best timing for posts
                    </h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="../../images/blog/increase-subscribers/using-own-time.jpg"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>There used to be "happy hours" on Instagram. This was a time in which you could post a post
                        and
                        it
                        would gain a large number of likes, people would subscribe to the account, and interact with
                        the
                        content. At the moment, there is no such time. And each person, by "trial and error," has to
                        pick
                        his or her own time.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that each target audience enters the social network differently to view posts.
                        And
                        there
                        is a "good time" for each profile. To use this method successfully, you should:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Study the statistics of likes, engagement of subscribers in publications;</li>
                        <li>Change the time for displaying of posts and to watch dynamics;</li>
                        <li>Test the frequency of posting content by day and week;</li>
                        <li>Create new content, if the old one is not interesting for the users.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="mt-2">Teamwork on Instagram</h2>

                    <p>It's not uncommon for major bloggers to team up to work on promoting and raising their reach.
                        First
                        and foremost, they like each other's posts. There is an unproven opinion that a like from a
                        blogger
                        with more than 5,000 subscribers has a much better impact on the profile than the same like
                        from
                        a
                        user with 500 subscribers. In such teams, bloggers share information, news, and test new
                        techniques
                        together.</p>
                    <p>To find such a team, you can join the chats that are in Telegram.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">
                        Using stories
                    </h2>

                    <p>Any blogger account is required to post at least 10 stories a day. Subscribers do not always
                        pay
                        attention to the posts, they are more interested in looking at a person's real life, which
                        is
                        duplicated periodically in stories.</p>
                    <p>In Stories, you can do a pretty good job of boosting your reach with activity. There are many
                        tools
                        for this in Instagram: ask questions, tests, questionnaires and so on. Drawings, contests,
                        quizzes
                        are good ways to get involved. Subscribers always don't mind "playing", relaxing, winning
                        prizes.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">
                        Communicating with subscribers
                    </h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="../../images/blog/increase-subscribers/talking-with-subscribers.jpg"

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>It's important to imagine that subscribers are friends who are currently there and you need
                        to
                        have
                        a dialogue with them. In each post, you can place a question that people should answer in
                        the
                        comments. You can also call them to action. For example, some bloggers explicitly ask their
                        subscribers to leave a like or write a comment under the post.</p>
                    <p>With all the updates of the Instagram, we all have to put up with and adjust to this social
                        network.
                        If before, any Instagram user could see every post, now it is only a pipe dream.</p>
