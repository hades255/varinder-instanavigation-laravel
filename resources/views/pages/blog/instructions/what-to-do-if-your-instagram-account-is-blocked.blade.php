                    <p>The biggest fear of any blogger is to be blocked by the administration of Instagram and lose
                        their
                        account forever. At the moment this happens quite often. In this case, the social network
                        does
                        not
                        even give a chance to save or return photos and posts.</p>
                    <p>To avoid such a situation, you need to know not only the reasons why an account can be
                        blocked,
                        but
                        also how to restore it, if it suddenly happens.</p>

                    <h2>
                        Reasons for blocking Instagram profiles
                    </h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, the rules of Instagram change frequently, and the list of prohibited actions
                        is
                        getting longer each update. But the basic, gross mistakes, followed by an eternal ban, are
                        worth
                        knowing for every blogger. Here they are:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Constant complaints about spam and comments under posts;</li>
                        <li>A large number of marks in publications or stories;</li>
                        <li>Sending messages to Direct that resemble spam in style;</li>
                        <li>Violation of the author's rights. That is, using other people's photos, videos, music,
                            publications, and so on, in the account;
                        </li>
                        <li>Additional profiles, which are exactly like the main one. If one of them will be
                            blocked,
                            they
                            may block all similar profiles;
                        </li>
                        <li>Exposing erotic content. This also includes photos/videos of children in nudity;</li>
                        <li>Promoting anorexia or suicide in the profile. May also be blocked if there are
                            complaints
                            that
                            the account information has led users to digestive disorders or attempts to end their
                            lives;
                        </li>
                        <li>The page contains negative, hateful, aggressive content, display of intolerant behavior;
                        </li>
                        <li>Sale of illegal products: weapons, drugs;</li>
                        <li>Use the content logos of famous brands. Therefore, it will not be possible to carry out
                            the
                            sale of fake products or replicas on Instagram;
                        </li>
                        <li>The social network will quickly block the account with Instagram logo on photos;</li>
                        <li>Collaboration with extraneous services for scamming, auxiliary actions and so on;</li>
                        <li>If the profile often exceeds the limits for making subscriptions, accepting subscribers
                            to a
                            closed account, likes, leaving comments and so on;
                        </li>
                        <li>Using multiple IP addresses at once. This can happen if one account is used in different
                            cities, or from different devices;
                        </li>
                        <li>The presence in texts, photos, videos contact data, information about accounts, cards,
                            wallets, passport data, any information about identity documents and so on;
                        </li>
                        <li>The use of extraneous services, tampering with subscribers, likes, views, comments;</li>
                        <li>Openly conducting drawings, giving away prizes or cash.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2 class="mt-4">What is temporary blocking</h2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/blog/to-do-to-unlock-account/temporary-block.jpg') }}"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Often, for most infractions, Instagram will disable the account from using certain features.
                        For
                        example, for excessive commenting, the administration will temporarily block this function
                        for
                        the
                        profile. Instagram may make such block for several hours, sometimes for several days.</p>
                    <p>If this happens, you should not react aggressively, write to technical support, or try to
                        persistently perform the same actions. Moreover, after unlocking, you should not use this
                        function
                        again, otherwise Instagram will again consider it a violation and may take more serious
                        penalties.</p>
                    <p>The administration often resets the account password to avoid hacking pages. It sends a
                        letter to
                        the user's email notifying them of the temporary blocking and violations. The password can
                        be
                        restored by the link provided in the email.</p>


                    <p>
                        Once 3 temporary locks occur, Instagram can permanently ban the account. This is regarded as
                        disobedience to the rules, disregard for penalties.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4">Actions after permanent blocking</h2>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 mb-3 mt-2">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/blog/to-do-to-unlock-account/unlock-actions.jpg') }}"
                                class="post-image-on-full-width" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Once the profile accumulates a certain number of violations, Instagram deletes the page
                        without
                        the
                        possibility of restoring access to it. This is called an eternal ban. What do they usually
                        do in
                        such cases? What actions to take, and is it worth trying to restore the page at all?</p>
                    <p>The most common way is to claim your account has been compromised, even though this is not
                        entirely
                        true. In addition, you can only try to unlock the profile through the official Instagram app
                        on
                        your
                        mobile device. The computer in this case will not help in any way.</p>
                    <p>There is a specific algorithm for restoring the profile on the social network's technical
                        support
                        site. But it is worth remembering that it does not work for everyone and not in all cases.
                        Therefore, it is not necessary to rely on it.</p>


                    <p>This is what the algorithm itself looks like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open the official social networking app on your smartphone or any mobile device;</li>
                        <li>Find a "Login Help" button. It is located directly under the "Login" button;</li>
                        <li>Follow all the instructions that will appear on the screen;</li>
                        <li>Fill out a form with the information about the identity of the owner, as well as an
                            email
                            address;
                        </li>
                        <li>To the specified e-mail should come a letter with further instructions. It is not
                            uncommon
                            for
                            such an email to end up in the spam folder, so it should also be checked.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>To unlock the account Instagram may ask the owner to send several unprocessed photos that
                        were
                        previously published on the page. The app may also ask for a personal photo of the person
                        with a
                        piece of paper on which a certain code must be written.</p>
                    <p>Some bloggers who have lost their accounts turn to unblocking specialists. In most cases,
                        professionals help restore accounts.</p>
                    <p>It is important not to violate the rules of the social network, so as not to be in danger of
                        being
                        blocked. Not always and not everyone succeeds in restoring access. There is no one hundred
                        percent
                        method that will help cope with this problem. Therefore, there is no point in taking risks
                        in
                        this
                        case.</p>
