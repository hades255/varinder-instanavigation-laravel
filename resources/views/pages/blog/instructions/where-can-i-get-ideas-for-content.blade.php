                        interesting
                        posts. Therefore, the design of your content should be of high quality.
                        You need to know the main types of content and have an unlimited number of ideas in order
                        for
                        the
                        blogging feed to interest the target audience. Below are examples of various content, as
                        well as
                        some ideas for implementation.</p>

                    <p>An Instagram post is not just a picture and a text. This is a long and hard work of a blogger
                        to
                        promote and develop his page. You should understand that there are several classifications
                        of
                        content. And each type of content has its own function.</p>

                    <h2>What types of content are there</h2>

                                    Informational. Subscribers should trust any blogger and commercial account. The
                                    informational type of content exists just for this.
                                    The text of such a post should benefit the target audience. They start to trust

                                    gains expertise.
                                    If we mean insta stores, then there should be about 50 percent of informational
                                    posts in the feed. Such texts well reveal the essence and usefulness of the
                                    product
                                    for potential buyers.

                            Content for entertainment. Subscribers are people too, and sometimes they want to
                            receive
                            not only benefit, but also entertainment from their favorite bloggers. Such content is
                            necessary for the audience to change scenery so that they do not get bored in the
                            profile.
                            You can lure people into communication through entertainment. Thus, you increase the
                            activity and loyalty of the entire audience as a whole. This is important for the
                            development of your account. Entertainment in the blogger's content mostly takes up
                            about 20
                            percent.
                            What can we attribute to such posts?

                                    Selling posts. When the audience begins to trust the blogger and treat him
                                    loyally,
                                    you can start using selling content. Such posts attract customers and encourage
                                    them
                                    to make a purchase. No more than 30 percent of such content is used in the feed.

                    <p>First of all, bloggers work on their content on their own. These are their profiles, they
                        make
                        money
                        from it, and it's profitable for them to come up with ideas on how to attract subscribers.
                        But
                        not
                        everyone has unlimited imagination and creativity. And if a person is unable to draw up a
                        content
                        plan on their own, he hires specially trained people who provide such services.</p>

                    <p>What if your blog has just begun its development and you don't want to hire specialists? You
                        can
                        pick up ideas on the Internet, see examples from competitors, ask for help from friends and
                        family.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Below are some examples of posts for different types of content that you can use for any
                        type of
                        blog.
                    </p>

                    <p>Ideas for informational posts:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Introduce an interesting section in your profile. For example, «Product of the week».
                            Sell
                            this product at a discount all week.
                        </li>
                        <li>Post-questionnaire. Take the most interesting and popular questions in the comments and
                            answer
                            them in Stories.
                        </li>
                        <li>A story about what is planned in the near future. For example, describe future
                            promotions,
                            warn subscribers about the upcoming start of the contest, tell about the upcoming
                            marathon.
                        </li>
                        <li>Describe the history of the store, where the idea came from. If your blog is personal,
                            then
                            tell how and why you decided to become a blogger.
                        </li>
                        <li>Publish once a month (it is possible with a different frequency) company news, what
                            interesting happened over the past 30 days.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Ideas for entertainment content:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take a photo of a sunrise or a mug of coffee and wish good morning to subscribers in the
                            text.
                            You can ask how the new day began for them.
                        </li>
                        <li>If your blog is about selling products, then you could write a funny story about how one
                            of
                            the products was used in an unusual way.
                        </li>
                        <li>Ask subscribers for their opinion on a popular subject, person, or event.</li>
                        <li>Tell about the good deeds that the company or the blogger himself regularly performs.
                            For
                            example, donations to foundations, care for nature, and so on.
                        </li>
                        <li>Organize the game in a post. For example, asking a riddle about a service or product
                            selling
                            on a blog.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Ideas for selling content:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Describe what promotions and discounts are currently available.</li>
                        <li>Reviews from real buyers and pictures of happy customers with products.</li>
                        <li>Organize special offers and auctions.</li>
                        <li>Tell a real story about the life of a customer who once solved his problem by buying a
                            product/service from a blog.
                        </li>
                        <li>Organize a contest that allows them to participate after purchasing a specific product
                            from
                            a
                            store.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        The content of any blogger or insta store should be not only useful but also varied. The
                        target
                        audience should want to visit the profile on a daily basis to read posts and share their own
                        opinion in the comments. Therefore, you need to carefully work out content plans for your
                        accounts, create new ideas, follow new products and trends.
